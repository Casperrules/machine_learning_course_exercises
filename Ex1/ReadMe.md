# Exercise-1
In this exercise we use octave and are given a bunch of files and a dataset on hypothetical housing prices to work on.
This is the second week's programming assignment for the coursera Machine Learning course Stanford University instructed by Andrew Ng
We are given the dataset to play with and we are supposed to complete the functions for prediction of housing prices using linear regression,
the cost function, gradient descent, and normal equation implementation to find the optimised theta values.
### Octave
It is an open source matlab alternative supports almost all the functions as in matlab
