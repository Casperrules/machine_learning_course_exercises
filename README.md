# Machine_learning_course_exercises
This repository holds all the machine learning exercises done for the coursera course of machine learning.
All the codes are matlab codes.

## Exercise-1:
In this exercise, we see how to implement the linear regression. Use gradient descent for parameter optimizations and plot the cost function.
The dataset provided was for a hypothetical housing price prediction.

## Exercise-2:
Exercise 2 deals with implementation of logistic regression over a dataset for prediction of admission of a student. We also implement regularization over the dataset to overcome the problem of overfitting of the function. We plot the datapoints and the decision boundary to visualize the fitting on the data.
we predict the test data to be positive if the value of hypothesis is >= 0.5 else negative.


## Exercise-3:
The problem statement in this problem was to recognize hand written charecters using logistic regression oneVsAll and neural network approach using matlab.We implement both approaches using the sigmoid activation function. The dataset for the task was provided and also the sample images. Further, we can use image processing libraries for matlab and capture real time images to predict the hand written number. This is the fourth week exercise for the coursera machine learning course by Andrew Ng. The files contain functions for cost function, prediction using logistic regression oneVsAll, prediction using nural net, function to train oneVsAll,and function to display the data. fmincg is used to get the optimum parameter values.
