# Machine_learning_course_exercises
This repository holds all the machine learning exercises done for the coursera course of machine learning.
All the codes are matlab codes.

## Exercise-1:
In this exercise, we see how to implement the linear regression. Use gradient descent for parameter optimizations and plot the cost function.
The dataset provided was for a hypothetical housing price prediction.

## Exercise-2:
Exercise 2 deals with implementation of logistic regression over a dataset for prediction of admission of a student. We also implement regularization over the dataset to overcome the problem of overfitting of the function. We plot the datapoints and the decision boundary to visualize the fitting on the data.
we predict the test data to be positive if the value of hypothesis is >= 0.5 else negative.
